# @moc-global/loft-queue-sqs-strategy

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- bc747ee: The `@moc-global/loft-definitions` peer dependency moves to its next major version, which needs zod 4 (`^4.6.6`) instead of zod 3. Upgrade `@moc-global/loft-definitions` and install zod 4 together with this release; this package's own API is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [bc747ee]
  - @moc-global/loft-definitions@2.0.0

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b009ff6: Update `sqs-consumer` from 10 to 15. `subscribe()` still deletes a message once the worker resolves and keeps it when the worker rejects; from sqs-consumer 14 that needs the handler to return the message, which it now does. `consumerOptions` gains the options sqs-consumer added, such as `strictReturn`.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 19ede7d: Declare the libraries LOFT shares with your code as peer dependencies, and fill in the package metadata.

  - inversify, reflect-metadata, zod, the MCP SDK, `@moc-global/loft-definitions` (and `@moc-global/loft` for `loft-agents`) and the SDKs that appear in the public types (`openai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `@google/genai`, `@aws-sdk/client-sqs`) are peer dependencies instead of dependencies, so your project and LOFT use one copy of each. A custom constructor written against your own inversify now compiles. LOFT needs inversify 6 and zod 3. npm 7 or later and pnpm install missing peers on their own; with Yarn, add them to your dependencies.
  - `langfuse` is an optional peer dependency of `@moc-global/loft`, loaded only when a `LangfuseTracer` is created. If you use `LangfuseTracer`, install `langfuse` yourself; without it, the constructor throws an error that says so.
  - zod is no longer pinned to exactly 3.25.67; any zod 3 from 3.25.67 on works.
  - Every package declares the MIT license, a description, keywords, homepage, issue tracker and the `MoC-OSS/LOFT` repository with its directory.

### Patch Changes

- 19ede7d: Update dependencies to fix security advisories.

  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: `^1.26.0` -> `^1.31.0`
  - `axios`: `^1.13.5` -> `^1.20.0`
  - `fast-copy`: `^3.0.2` -> `^3.1.0`
  - `kysely`: `^0.27.3` -> `^0.28.17`
  - `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/client-sqs`: -> `^3.1140.0` (pulls a patched `fast-xml-parser`)

- 19ede7d: Declare the supported Node.js versions: `engines.node` is `>=22`. CI tests Node 22, 24 and 26.
- 19ede7d: Fix the ES module builds, and publish only the built code.

  - `loft-llm-call-manager` works when imported as an ES module: `GenerateCallManager` and `GenerateWithQueueManager` no longer throw `PQueue is not a constructor`.
  - The Postgres repositories load as ES modules, and `runSessionPgMigrations` and `runChatHistoryPgMigrations` find their migrations from both builds. Their library entry no longer bundles the migration CLI (yargs, dotenv). `SessionMigrationOptions` and `ChatHistoryMigrationOptions` are exported, and `databaseSsl` is optional (default false).
  - Each package is built from its `index.ts` into one bundle per format, and the tarball holds only `lib` (and `bin` for `loft-definitions`), so tests, sources and `tsconfig.json` are no longer published. `@moc-global/loft` unpacks to 1.0 MB instead of 6.5 MB. Only the package root was ever exported, so imports do not change.
  - Unused runtime dependencies are removed: `axios`, `fast-copy` and `openai` from `loft`; `axios`, `uuid` and `zod-to-json-schema` from `loft-openai-strategy`; `uuid` from the Gemini, LLM call manager and Postgres packages. `zod` moves to `devDependencies` in the S3, GCP, Azure, SQS and LLM call manager packages, which use it only in tests. Code that imported one of these through LOFT must declare it itself.

- 19ede7d: Ship ES module types and the MIT license file.

  - Code that imports a package now gets ES module type declarations (`.d.mts`) that match the `.mjs` build; code that requires it keeps the CommonJS declarations (`.d.ts`). Before, both got the CommonJS declarations, so TypeScript with `moduleResolution: node16` or `nodenext` typed ES module imports as CommonJS. `package.json` is exported too.
  - Every package ships the MIT `LICENSE`. `@moc-global/loft-definitions` also ships a `NOTICE` for the types it copies from the MCP TypeScript SDK (MIT, Anthropic, PBC).

- 19ede7d: Fix parallel tool calls, tool errors and silent failures.

  - Anthropic: the results of parallel tool calls go back in one user message, so the second and later results are no longer dropped. A failed tool result is sent with `is_error`.
  - OpenAI: each tool result becomes its own `tool` message, and a result without text is sent as empty text instead of being dropped.
  - Gemini: a failed tool result is sent under the `error` key.
  - Tool messages from parallel calls are saved to chat history: the integrity check counts tool calls and tool results, not messages.
  - MCP: the text of a tool that reports `isError` reaches the model, and an empty successful result is a success with empty content.
  - Chat history rejects a message whose `sessionId` differs from the session it is added to.
  - `LlmManager.getPrompt(ctx, promptName, llmName)` now takes its arguments in that order, and `ManifestManager.getPrompt` reads `prompts[promptName][llmName]`. `ctx.getPrompt` already worked; code that called `LlmManager.getPrompt` directly must swap its last two arguments.
  - `SQSStrategy.publish` waits for the send and rejects when it fails. A failed queued task is logged instead of crashing the process with an unhandled rejection.
  - `LoftConstructor.validateManifest()` returns the promise of the manifest check.
  - The migration CLIs exit with code 1 when a migration fails.
  - Postgres migrations use the `schemaName` passed to `runSessionPgMigrations` and `runChatHistoryPgMigrations` instead of reading `DATABASE_*_SCHEMA_NAME` and a `.env` file. Behaviour change: the schema name must be lower-case letters, digits and underscores (at most 63), and other names are rejected before anything runs. Mixed-case or hyphenated names already failed in the chat history migrations, which pasted the name into the SQL unquoted. A missing schema now throws instead of exiting the process. The migration CLIs still read the schema name from their env file.
  - Both Postgres packages declare `dotenv`, which their migration CLI loads.
